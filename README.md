# Details
A sample project made for the Middle Earth Mod Loader using its simple mod menu and logging API. Implements a plugin with a mod menu containing some sample settings and hosts some skeleton code which can be expanded to fit your needs.

## How To Use
It's a very simple compilation process, the only thing that is required is Visual Studio 2022 with the MSVC compiler.

After cloning the repo or downloading the source code in a .zip, it compiles straight to a .dll file which can be placed in the plugins folder of the game for use.

Further information and explanations can be found on the [**page of the mod loader**](https://github.com/ReaperAnon/Middle-Earth-Mod-Loader) or in the **modloaderapi.h** header file included in the project.
